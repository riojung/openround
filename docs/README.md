## Build and operate

- [Implementation status](implementation-status.md) describes what is implemented and what remains a release gate.
- [Release readiness ledger](release-readiness.json) is the machine-validated source of truth for
  single-VM beta and GA promotion gates; [evidence templates](evidence/README.md) cover human and
  provider verification.
- [Production readiness](runbooks/production-readiness.md) is the promotion checklist for a public environment.
- [Build, service, and deployment](runbooks/deployment.md) is the command reference for product
  images, local service lifecycle, and digest-pinned remote single-VM promotion.
- [Single-VM staging readiness](runbooks/staging-readiness.md),
  [repository governance](runbooks/repository-governance.md),
  [backup and restore](runbooks/backup-restore.md), [upgrade](runbooks/upgrade.md),
  [audience interaction moderation](runbooks/audience-moderation.md),
  [incident response](runbooks/incident-response.md), and
  [observability](runbooks/observability.md) cover release and routine operations.
- [Free-pilot Cloud Run guidance](../infra/cloudrun/README.md) is a separate pilot reference. The
  [Fly profile](../infra/fly/README.md) is legacy/reference material, not an active target.
- [Privacy data map](privacy-data-map.md) identifies stored data, purpose, and retention behavior.
- [Institution integrations](institution-integrations.md) documents creator OIDC, instructor LTI,
  audit export, residency evidence, and the capabilities that remain deliberately disabled.
- [Asset register](asset-register.md) records the origin and licensing of bundled product assets.
- [Creator authentication ADR](decisions/001-creator-authentication.md) records the deliberate P0
  choice and migration triggers.

## Release boundary

Development uses the local Compose stack. Staging and production use a remote single-VM Compose
profile with digest-pinned images and separate runtime and migration credentials. This topology
has one failure domain and provides no high availability or SLA. It remains blocked for public
production until TLS, strict SSH host-key pinning, encrypted off-host backups, a clean
replacement-VM restore drill, target-host capacity evidence, and all other readiness gates pass.
The repository and deployment scripts do not establish that any environment has been provisioned
or deployed, nor do they establish legal approval, school-contract readiness, external security
assurance, or production capacity.

The signed-in `/help` page is available in the default Compose profile and adapts its written
steps and destinations to the active rollout. Its two captioned professional-builder videos are
shown only when the workspace shell, Round Builder v2, Presentations, Groups, Discover, and
practice assignments are all enabled for that allowlisted workspace.
