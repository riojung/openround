# Upgrade and rollback runbook

1. Read release notes and verify the image digest, signature, SBOM, and vulnerability report.
2. Back up PostgreSQL and confirm a recent restore exercise.
3. Apply expand-only schema changes with the owner-only `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`. Keep the
   application `DATABASE_URL` on a non-owner role granted `openround_runtime`, and verify forced
   row-level security with the production-like integration test. New code must tolerate both old
   and new columns during the deployment window. The published server image exposes the one-shot
   `node dist/migrate.js` command; run it from a restricted maintenance job and never place
   `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` in the long-lived server environment.
4. Deploy to staging and run the synthetic creator, host, three-player, reconnect, finish, report, and deletion flow.
5. Promote one canary, check error rate, event-loop lag, acknowledgement latency, reconnects, database pool, Redis latency, and reconciliation.
6. Promote production only when thresholds remain normal.
7. Roll back by deploying the prior immutable image. Do not reverse a destructive database migration; use the documented forward repair.
8. Contract or remove old schema only in a later release after every running version has stopped using it.

## Presentation concurrent-response rollout

`PRESENTATION_CONCURRENT_RESPONSE_WRITES` defaults to `false`. Leave it off while a prior server
image can still receive traffic: the compatibility trigger then advances the stored session fence
that image reads. After the expand release is the only serving version, verify reconnect and report
reconciliation, then enable the switch to use the commit-visible per-session aggregate fence and
remove response-row contention.

Before starting a prior-image rollback, disable the switch on every current instance and wait for
them to restart. Then, from the owner-only migration connection, reconcile the stored compatibility
counter while briefly fencing joins and responses:

```sql
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE presentation_live_participants, presentation_live_responses
  IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;
UPDATE presentation_live_sessions AS session
SET event_seq = GREATEST(
  session.event_seq,
  session.revision
    + (SELECT count(*) FROM presentation_live_participants AS participant
       WHERE participant.session_id = session.id)
    + (SELECT count(*) FROM presentation_live_responses AS response
       WHERE response.session_id = session.id)
);
COMMIT;
```

Only after that transaction succeeds may the prior image start serving. The trigger remains
installed, so its subsequent writes continue advancing the stored fence.

Do not enable the switch merely because the migration completed. Record the serving image set,
configuration change, rollback rehearsal, and 50/250-client results as one release evidence set.
