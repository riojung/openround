# Polling Pops

**Make every voice pop.** Live polls, interactive presentations, learning rounds, and
audience conversation in one privacy-preserving workspace. Formerly OpenRound; existing
self-hosted configuration and stored content remain compatible.

![Polling Pops](apps/web/public/brand/polling-pops-logo.svg)

The [brand guide](docs/brand.md) covers the original lollipop logo, berry/cream/mint theme,
dark mode, and downloadable assets. New blank Rounds and Presentations use **Candy Pop**.

**Accountless, server-authoritative comprehension recovery for live learning.**

Polling Pops helps higher-education and workplace facilitators identify confusion, make an
explainable intervention, recheck understanding, and review bounded evidence. Participants join
live sessions without creating accounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Polling Pops is pre-1.0 software with no published release yet. The repository contains a working
> local Community stack, but public production, institutional, legal, accessibility, security,

## Why Polling Pops

Most audience-response tools stop after showing whether an answer was right. Polling Pops is built
around a recovery loop:

**Ask → diagnose → intervene → recheck → review**

- **Accountless participation:** people join with a seven-digit code or direct link and use a
  session-scoped alias; Polling Pops does not create a persistent learner profile in Learning mode.
- **Explainable recovery:** facilitators can act on deterministic aggregate insights, deliver an
  intervention, and open a linked recheck or revote.
- **Reliable live state:** the server owns deadlines, scoring, revisions, and accepted answers;
  idempotency and reconnect flows protect acknowledged work.
- **Safe publishing:** drafts support six response types, confidence, concepts, rationales, and
  linked rechecks. Published versions are immutable.
- **Useful evidence:** asynchronous reports, CSV/JSON exports, self-paced follow-ups, and practice
  assignments preserve the distinction between paired and aggregate evidence.
- **Self-hostable foundations:** the modular monolith runs with PostgreSQL, Valkey, private object
  storage, and optional media scanning and observability profiles.

The default Community experience focuses on live Rounds and their recovery workflow. The
professional workspace, Presentations, and research prototypes are pre-release capabilities
controlled by their deployment flags and applicable workspace allowlists. Source-grounded
authoring is disabled by default; configuring its provider enables it deployment-wide subject to
workspace roles and plan entitlements, not a rollout allowlist. Institution integrations require
provider configuration plus a per-workspace contract policy. Their presence in the repository is
not a launch or readiness claim.

Current optional beta workflows include whole-room flex timing, advisory **Question Health**
reviews of saved drafts and published versions, aggregate post-use observations, and a report
**Decision replay** of recorded facilitator actions. Presentations combine interactive questions
with structured content slides, bounded text positioning and resizing, and shared preview/live
rendering. Workspace owners can also permanently delete archived Library items and finished or
expired session history, subject to retained-use checks. See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md)
for the workflows and the [quick start's beta configuration](docs/quick-start.md#optional-beta-workflows)
for their deployment gates.

## Quick start

You need Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2, at least 2 GB of available memory,
and local ports `8080`, `8025`, and `9000`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riojung/pollingpops.git
cd pollingpops
docker compose up --build --detach --wait
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

Then open:

- Polling Pops: <http://localhost:8080>
- Development email inbox: <http://localhost:8025>

Use any valid development email address to request a sign-in link, then open the captured message
in Mailpit. The core profile uses development credentials and disables untrusted image uploads
because no malware scanner is attached.

Stop the stack while preserving its PostgreSQL, Valkey, and MinIO named volumes. Captured Mailpit
messages and unused development sign-in links are ephemeral and will be discarded:

```bash
docker compose down
```

For the first-Round walkthrough, cross-device setup, optional media profile, and troubleshooting,
follow the [complete quick start](docs/quick-start.md). For profile-aware restarts, full rebuilds,
and safe Docker disk cleanup, use the [operations runbook](docs/runbooks/deployment.md).
Existing clones and hosts should also read the
[repository rename guide](docs/runbooks/repository-rename.md) before changing deployment paths.

## Architecture

Polling Pops is a TypeScript monorepo organized as a modular monolith. Runtime-validated contracts and
pure domain packages are shared by the browser and server, while live state remains
server-authoritative.

```

The main workspaces are:

| Path                   | Responsibility                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`             | Creator, host, presenter, and participant interfaces |
| `apps/server`          | REST, realtime coordination, jobs, and authorization |
| `packages/contracts`   | Versioned schemas and public data contracts          |
| `packages/game-engine` | Pure server-authoritative game transitions           |
| `packages/db`          | Memory/PostgreSQL repositories and migrations        |
| `packages/experience`  | Accessible, versioned Round experience definitions   |

Read [Architecture and protocol](docs/architecture.md) for state flows, trust boundaries, and
scaling constraints, or the [API and realtime reference](docs/api.md) for interfaces.

## Development

Host-native development requires Node.js 22 or newer and pnpm 10.15.1:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

`pnpm check` runs formatting, Docker-context validation, linting, type checks, tests, and builds.
The host-native application also needs explicit development environment variables; use the
[native development recipe](docs/quick-start.md#optional-native-developer-mode) rather than copying
the Compose-oriented `.env.example` unchanged.
